CMake scripts to register GDB pretty printers for ITK on targets.

If the following is in your CMakeLists.txt,

  add_executable( myexe main.cxx )
  target_link_libraries( myexe ITKCommon ITKIO )

then the CMake function GDB_PRETTY_ITK() can be applied to let GDB know that
*myexe* contains objects that can be examined with ITK pretty-printers.

  GDB_PRETTY_ITK( myexe )

CMake configuration variables are also made available to indicate which ITK
pretty-printers are installed.
